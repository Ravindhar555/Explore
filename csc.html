        RESEARCH TOPICS & IDEAS: COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
        </h1>
        <p>Computer science and engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture)</p>

        <p>Technology have significantly improved our lives and changed how we live. The most recent developments in computer science can alter our future through technology. Technologies like machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), cloud computing, 5G networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are rapidly changing and reshaping industries while also creating new opportunities and applications. Advanced technology also poses threats which include job displacement, hacking and security, data privacy, and algorithm complexity. We must develop the skills necessary to fully utilize Computer Science & Technology. Research in computer science can assist us in making the most beneficial use of technology. PhD assistance may assist you in choosing the latest topic for pursuing research in computer science & technology.</p>
